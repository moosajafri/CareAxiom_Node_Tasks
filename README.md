# CareAxiom_Node_Tasks

First two tasks have been done.
I was kind of stuck in the third task so I did not complete it, However I've uploaded its code too.
Let me know if you want the live demo for these tasks,
I'll run these on my local host and expose my localhost through the 'ngrok' application and share the public url with you.

Following are some of the websites i had to visit for help:

http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/
http://webapplog.com/url-parameters-and-routing-in-express-js/
http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2265406&seqNum=2
http://metaduck.com/01-asynchronous-iteration-patterns.html
http://tobyho.com/2011/11/02/callbacks-in-loops/
http://book.mixu.net/node/ch7.html
https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_close_fd_callback

Also, since I am completely new to node, 
The code i've written might not be very efficient and i'm sure there must be better ways of doing the 
given tasks.
